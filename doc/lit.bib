	ABSTRACT = {To solve the problem of multi-fault blind source separation (BSS) in the case that the observed signals are under-determined, a novel approach for single channel blind source separation (SCBSS) based on the improved tensor-based singular spectrum analysis (TSSA) is proposed. As the most natural representation of high-dimensional data, tensor can preserve the intrinsic structure of the data to the maximum extent. Thus, TSSA method can be employed to extract the multi-fault features from the measured single-channel vibration signal. However, SCBSS based on TSSA still has some limitations, mainly including unsatisfactory convergence of TSSA in many cases and the number of source signals is hard to accurately estimate. Therefore, the improved TSSA algorithm based on canonical decomposition and parallel factors (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) weighted optimization, namely CP-WOPT, is proposed in this paper. CP-WOPT algorithm is applied to process the factor matrix using a first-order optimization approach instead of the original least square method in TSSA, so as to improve the convergence of this algorithm. In order to accurately estimate the number of the source signals in BSS, EMD-SVD-BIC (empirical mode decomposition—singular value decomposition—Bayesian information criterion) method, instead of the SVD in the conventional TSSA, is introduced. To validate the proposed method, we applied it to the analysis of the numerical simulation signal and the multi-fault rolling bearing signals.},

	abstract = {The precise classification of land covers with hyperspectral imagery (HSI) is a major research-focused topic in remote sensing, especially using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems as the abundant data sources have brought severe intra-class spectral variability and high spatial heterogeneity challenges, making precise classification difficult. To this end, a novel three-dimensional singular spectrum analysis (3DSSA) method is proposed for the 3D feature extraction of HSI. It aims to construct a low-rank trajectory tensor containing global and local features and extract both spectral discrimination features and spatial contextual features in conjunction with tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD). To reduce the risk of tensor operations exceeding memory on large-scale HSI data, the extended regional clustering (RC) 3DSSA framework (RC-3DSSA) is proposed for precise HSI classification. RC-3DSSA uses RC processing to alleviate the scale diversity and further applies 3DSSA to tackle issues of intra-class spectral variability and spatial heterogeneity. In order to effectively evaluate the performance of RC-3DSSA, a new challenging classification dataset namely the Qingdao UAV-borne HSI (QUH) dataset was further built. It consists of three sub-datasets: QUH-Tangdaowan, QUH-Qingyun, and QUH-Pingan, which are freely available as benchmarks for precise land cover classification. The experimental results on QUH and two publicly available datasets show that the RC-3DSSA can accurately distinguish ground objects and reliably map their distribution when benchmarked with ten state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the overall accuracies achieved are 86.62, 87.51, and 87.35 under 10 spatially disjoint training samples for the three UAV-borne HSI datasets, respectively, providing the best performance.}
